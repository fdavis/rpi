# RPI Installers

This repository contains a bunch of scripts automating the installation
of various things on a RPI.

First run `./format.sh` then one of the `./*/install.sh` script,
depending on the purpose of the RPI.

`./format.sh` will format the SD Card so you _will_ lose everything
that's on it. It will download the latest arch distribution while
partitioning the disks with fdisk and then use qemu to chroot into the
RPI and install a network profile for netctl.

`./fileserver/install.sh` for now installs my [`conffiles`](https://github.com/ibizaman/conffiles).
